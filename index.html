      <p> Outer space has always been a fascination of mine; specifically the planets. During the research for this project, I came across the symbolic signs of the planets. This was the archival data used for this project. The planets and symbols were drawn on illustrator then uploaded to this sketch. My intention is to have the viewer explore what each different symbol looks like in front of each planet. Then, they can see which symbol they think looks best with a certain planet. </p>
